# porefect-alt
My unused theme for Porefect! Includes brainstorming sketches and original page layouts!
Went for a bright/citrus vibe; shows off some custom buttons and many other fruit themed items.

<ul>
  <li>
Deployed alternative theme: https://queenofbirbs.github.io/porefect-alt/index.html
<br>
Not functional like the deployed app, this version is purely to show off the unused theme and nothing more.
  </li>
<br>
<br>
  <li>
Final deplyed app: https://porefect.herokuapp.com/
    <br>
Fully functional but using a different theme.
  </li>
  </ul>

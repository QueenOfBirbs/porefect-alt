# Porefect Alt. Theme

## Description 

Here is a link to the deployed application on Github:

https://queenofbirbs.github.io/porefect-alt/index.html

My unused theme for Porefect! Includes brainstorming sketches and original page layouts!
Went for a bright/citrus vibe; shows off some custom buttons and many other fruit themed items. Not functional like the deployed app, this version is purely to show off the unused theme and nothing more.

Final deplyed app: https://porefect.herokuapp.com/
    <br>
Fully functional but using a different theme.
